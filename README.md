Team 2: Outliers

## DESCRIPTION

Using data from JMU's enrollment and parking decks we can find relationships that can inform students of where they should park to be able to find a spot. Using this we can also see where campus is the least congested at a certain time of day and where it is most congested and should be avoided.
